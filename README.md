# learning-systems
a system that helps people study effectively.
It is the second project that I am now currently working on. After two years of asking myself questions and pushing to investigate different types of ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of learning, I hope to make a system that can help me acquire different types of knowledge in an effective way.
I know that is an endurance process, but it is a worthwhile effort.
Just keep trying!
